# Data Structures and Algorithms
----------------------------------
This repository contains solutions to various data structure and algorithm problems from the GeeksforGeeks self-paced course. Each problem is implemented in C++.

## About the Course
The GeeksforGeeks self-paced course on data structures and algorithms is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental concepts and their practical implementation. It covers a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.

The solutions provided in this repository serve as a reference for the problems covered in the course. They can be used as a guide to understand different algorithms and their implementation. It is recommended to try solving the problems on your own before referring to the solutions.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured according to the topics covered in the GeeksforGeeks self-paced course. Each topic has its own folder, and within each folder, you will find the solutions to the related problems.
