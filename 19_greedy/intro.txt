1.Introduction of Greedy Algorithm ::
    Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution 
    piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers 
    the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems 
    where choosing locally optimal also leads to the global 
    optimal solution are best fit for Greedy.
